**Project Title** - 
Namma Yatri Data Analysis and Visualisation

**Project Summary** - 
This project analyses real world ride hailing data from Namma Yatri, a Bengaluru based mobility platform. The goal of the project is to use data analysis and visualisation to understand customer behaviour, driver performance, demand patterns, and revenue trends. The project demonstrates my ability to convert raw data into meaningful business insights and actionable recommendations.

**Business Problem** - 
Namma Yatri operates in a fast changing urban transport environment where demand varies by time, location, and customer preferences. The company needs data driven insights to reduce cancellations, improve driver efficiency, optimise payment methods, and better allocate resources. This project addresses these challenges through structured analysis and clear storytelling.

**Dataset Overview** - 
The dataset contains multiple tables related to trips, payments, locations, and time periods in Bengaluru. It includes information on trip requests, completed rides, cancellations, revenue, payment methods, and geographic zones. The data is cleaned, joined, and prepared before analysis to ensure accuracy.

**What I Did in This Project** - 
I performed end to end data analysis starting from data preparation to insight generation. I joined multiple tables, resolved data quality issues, and classified variables into numerical and categorical types. I conducted exploratory data analysis to identify peak demand hours, high revenue zones, popular payment methods, and cancellation trends. I analysed relationships between time, location, revenue, and trip success rates. I also created parameters and interactive filters to support dynamic analysis in dashboards.

**Key Insights** - 
The analysis identified peak demand time periods that contribute the most to revenue. High performing zones were recognised based on trip volume and earnings. Certain payment methods were found to be more popular and reliable. Cancellation patterns showed clear differences between driver and customer behaviour. The likelihood of trip completion after quote search varied significantly by time of day.

**Business Impact** - 
Based on the insights, I provided recommendations to improve operational efficiency, such as better driver allocation during peak hours and focused attention on high demand zones. Marketing and payment strategy improvements were suggested using customer behaviour patterns. These insights can help improve customer experience, reduce cancellations, and increase overall revenue.
